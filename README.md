This project is to showcase my skill with AI development and deployment. In this repository you will find a fully fledged digital twin that uses GradioUI as the front end and a configurable LLM. There is also a webservice that can be used to create a chat using any other technology. 

This is part of a demonstration of my skill. Additonally, you may also find another repo that will contain a sample ML model that uses Kaggle challenge for penguins. While the objective of the ML model is not to display my model building architectural knowledge but rather to portray and build a cogent case for my ability to design, develop and most importantly deploy the model. Both of these projects are work in progress as I juggle with my normal day to day activities and build this out. As I build I will be updating this file to specify the technology used and the skills I demonstrate.

My Objective is not only to learn but also help others who are starting off on their journey. I have used my years of experience to design the code in ways that I normally would with a project. In some of the courses that I have attended there are people who don't have any coding experience but brave enough to join to learn the concepts and using vibe coding to help them adapt in a world where code no longer holds the same value.  

My use of structure in the code may woefully seem over-engineered to some, but it is a reflection of how I approach real-world projects. It also might boldly announce my career using Java for over 2 decades. There are some pythonic standards that I might have missed. I also have used mostly classes as that is what I am most comfortable working with. 

To get to run the latest version 

1) Copy your .env file containing the keys to open api to the root folder
   OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_KEY}
2) Two ways (if you have just tool installed)
     "just run" from your terminal
    or 
      uv run gradio src/GradioUI.py
